Deforestation is a critical environmental issue that significantly impacts biodiversity, climate change, and human livelihoods. Accurate mapping and monitoring of deforestation are essential for effective forest management and conservation strategies. This project aims to develop a comprehensive deforestation mapping approach focusing on Dehradun, a district in India known for its rich forest cover. The primary objective is to analyze changes in forest cover over a five-year period, from 2015 to 2020, using remote sensing and advanced geospatial techniques.

Our project began with selecting Dehradun as the study area due to its ecological significance and the availability of high-quality remote sensing data. The initial step involved downloading the India map and extracting the Dehradun shapefile using ArcGIS software. This shapefile was then uploaded to the Copernicus Open Access Hub to acquire Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for the months of October to December 201, covering the entire Dehradun district across three tiles.

The downloaded Sentinel-2 data, specifically the MSI files, were processed using the SNAP software for atmospheric correction to ensure accuracy and consistency in the satellite imagery. Subsequently, these corrected images were imported into ArcGIS software for further analysis. We composited bands 2, 3, 4, and 8, which have a 10-meter resolution, to create a detailed and high-resolution image of the study area. These composite images were then mosaicked to combine the three tiles into a single seamless tile.

Using the Dehradun shapefile, we performed masking on this mosaicked tile to extract the area of interest, resulting in a raster file in .tif format. For the classification of land cover types, we employed both unsupervised and supervised classification methods. Initially, we used ISODATA clustering and K-means algorithms in Python and ArcGIS to perform unsupervised classification. Subsequently, training data were created and used to implement the Random Forest algorithm and Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) for supervised classification.

The classified output included six distinct classes: Evergreen Forest, Deciduous Forest, Cropland, Fallow Land, Water Bodies, and Developed Area. This classification provided a detailed land cover map for Dehradun for the year 2020. In the previous phase of the project, we have replicated this process for Sentinel-2 data from October to December 2015. This has allowed us to compare the datasets and observe changes in land cover over the five-year period.

The subsequent sections of this report will present the detailed methodology, results, and analysis for each classification technique, with a focus on the 2020 data. The previous semester has involved similar processing of the 2015 data to map deforestation trends and changes in Dehradun's land cover. This project not only highlights the importance of remote sensing in environmental monitoring but also provides valuable insights for forest conservation and management in the region.
